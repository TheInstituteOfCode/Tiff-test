        Hello! Thankyou so much for taking an interest in my website. My name is Tiffany, I am 30 years old and I am from Perth, Western Australia. A little background on who I am; I had a very "normal" childhood with two loving parents and an older brother. At school I was a good student, a bit of a book worm, I got bullied a bit and I struggled to fit in. This is something I have continued to struggle with; always feeling like a square peg trying to fit into a round hole, trying to get others approval, trying to find my place in the world.This struggle to find my place in the world, along with a few genetic predispositions led to several extremely low points in my life and being diagnosed with anxiety and depression at the age of 19.

          I spent my twenties yo-yoing between phases of travel and joy and phases of trying to 'settle down' and 'be normal'. While I wish I had the courage much sooner in life to just accept that convention, tradition and rules were not for me, I do not regret the journey I have been on and the experiences that have brought me to where I am and what I am doing today. I think that we often forget how important the journey is. We spend so much time comparing ourselves to others, but everyone's journey is different. And that is OK. It is only now in my in thirties that I feel I have a good grasp on my mental health, that I feel content and no longer need anyones approval. I want to share my journey as a source of education and inspiration for those who may not be there yet.

    <p>
      Talk+train+travel=happiness. This is the specific formula that works for me. I genuinely believe it is the combination of looking after your mind, body and soul that leads to happiness. It has taken me many years to find this balance and meet the needs of my mind, body and soul and I hope that I can help others find their happiness by sharing what I have learnt.

          I know what it is like to feel so low and so lost in life that you don't see the point. I also know what it is like to feel so alive and so overwhelmed with joy that everything makes sense. The journey from one to the other is an ongoing one but also one that I think in sharing, I can educate and inspire others.
