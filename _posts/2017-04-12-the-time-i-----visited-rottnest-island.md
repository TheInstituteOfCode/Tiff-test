I made this video as my entry for a competition to spend last summer in Europe with a tour company. My entry did not win, however, I did enjoy making it and it shows one of my favourite places to visit in Western Australia - Rottnest Island.&nbsp;

Rottnest is only a 40 minute ferry ride from Fremantle and with the new ferry service, it is more affordable than ever! Home of the Quokka, Rottnest was so named because when it was first discovered by Dutch explorers, the Quokka's were mistaken for giant rats. Rotte Nest is Ductch for Rats Nest and so came about the name Rottnest, or Rotto as we locals refer to it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

I highly recommend visiting Rotto if you are ever over in West Aus! I hope you enjoy my video :)
