  <h2>On my mind</h2>
  <p>
    Tiffany Talks is all about experiences I have had and lessons I have learned. Here is where I share my stuggles with mental health, dating disasters, the numerous careers paths I've had, beauty tips, growing up, getting older, educational experiences, choices I've made, opportunities I've had and much more. If there is a particular topic you would like me to discuss, please send me an email, I am always happy to discuss! If you are interested in having me talk about any of my experiences as a guest speaker, please have a look at my
