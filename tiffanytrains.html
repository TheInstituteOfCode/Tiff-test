  <h2>Keeping fit and healthy ...  </h2>
  <p>
    Tiffany Trains is all about how important it is for both body and mind to be fit and healthy. Here is where I share my thoughts about diet, my fitness journey, activewear that I choose, the mass of information and misinformation in the fitness industry, the routine(s) that have been effective for me and much more. If there is a particular topic about health and fitness that you would like me to discuss, please send me an email, I am always happy to discuss! If you are interested in what exercises I do, please check out my
