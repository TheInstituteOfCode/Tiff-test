        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
        This is for anyone who has ever felt they didn't fit in, they were different, there was something wrong with them, they were told they couldn't do certain things or live life a certain way. </p>
        <p>
        This is for anyone who sees life in techno-colour, who want to love their life, who value diversity and difference, who don't want to live the mould, who want to make the most of this one life we have.</p>
        <p>
        This is me. A girl who wants to educate and inspire others to create their own reality. No matter what challenges you face, and we ALL have challenges (mental health is my demon), you CAN be happy, you CAN love your life. </p>
