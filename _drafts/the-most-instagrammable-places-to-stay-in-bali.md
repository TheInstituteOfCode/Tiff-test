Choosing where to stay in Bali is hard. Choosing where to stay when you want to take really cool pics is harder…never fear, Tiffany is here! After much research, many emails, and double booking myself on more than 1 occasion; I have put together a list of the most Instagrammable places to stay in Bali!

##### The Instagram shot(s)

The variety of textures used in the construction of Tugu make it an awesome backdrop for fashion photography but make it difficult to capture the property in a way that does it justice. It is one of those places that you really have to see to truly appreciate. I had to walk around the property 3 times just to take it all in! The grounds of the hotel provided many gorgeous shots in the afternoon sunlight.

##### What's around

Located straight off the main street of Canggu, this sanctuary is a hidden gem! Directly across the road from the beach and both The Lawn and Old Mans (popular bars and eateries in Canggu) you will not find a better located hotel in the area. There are plenty of shops, cafes and beauty spas nearby as well. The 3 storey restaurant "Ji" attached to the hotel has uninterrupted ocean views and serves the best Japanese cuisine in Bali!&nbsp;

##### My experience

As soon as you enter the lobby area of Tugu, you know you have stumbled upon something special. The high ceilings, dark wooden beams, long red drapes and giant ancient statue centrepiece, it feels like you have taken a step back in history (royal history). I was greeted with a fresh juice as I was taken through the check-in process where I was informed that I would be given a 15 minute welcome massage and daily high tea between 430-630pm as well as breakfast. Stepping out of the main lobby area, I entered a labyrinth of pebbled pathways and wooden over pond walkways that led to the 21 rooms on the enormous property! My room was in the farthest corner of the resort as this room had a private pool with ocean views!&nbsp;
