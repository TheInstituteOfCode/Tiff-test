Choosing where to stay in Bali is hard. Choosing where to stay when you want to take really cool pics is harder…never fear, Tiffany is here! After much research, many emails, and double booking myself on more than 1 occasion; I have put together a list of the most Instagrammable places to stay in Bali!

## Tugu Hotel and Spa

##### Location: Canggu

##### Sleeps: 21 rooms, 2 guests per room.&nbsp;

##### Cost: High

##### Where to book it:

<ins class="bookingaff" data-aid="1525205" data-target_aid="1525205" data-prod="nsb" data-width="100%" data-height="auto" data-lang="en-AU" data-dest_id="254177" data-dest_type="hotel" data-df_num_properties="3" data-bk-touched="true"><iframe src="//www.booking.com/flexiproduct.html?product=nsb&amp;w=100%25&amp;h=auto&amp;lang=en-AU&amp;aid=1525205&amp;target_aid=1525205&amp;ss_id=254177&amp;ss_type=hotel&amp;df_num_properties=3&amp;fid=1526015591194&amp;" width="100%" height="221" scrolling="no" style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px; overflow: hidden; width: 100%; height: 221px;" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" id="booking_widget__1525205__1526015591194" data-responsive="true"></iframe></ins>

</script>

##### The Instagram shot(s)

The variety of textures used in the construction of Tugu make it an awesome backdrop for fashion photography but make it difficult to capture the property in a way that does it justice. It is one of those places that you really have to see to truly appreciate. I had to walk around the property 3 times just to take it all in! The grounds of the hotel provided many gorgeous shots in the afternoon sunlight. ![](/uploads/balihotels-36.jpg)

##### ![](/uploads/balihotels-41.jpg)

##### ![](/uploads/balihotels-39.jpg)

##### What's around

Located straight off the main street of Canggu, this sanctuary is a hidden gem! Directly across the road from the beach and both The Lawn and Old Mans (popular bars and eateries in Canggu) you will not find a better located hotel in the area. There are plenty of shops, cafes and beauty spas nearby as well. The 3 storey restaurant "Ji" attached to the hotel has uninterrupted ocean views and serves the best Japanese cuisine in Bali!&nbsp;

##### My experience

As soon as you enter the lobby area of Tugu, you know you have stumbled upon something special. The high ceilings, dark wooden beams, long red drapes and giant ancient statue centrepiece, it feels like you have taken a step back in history (royal history). I was greeted with a fresh juice as I was taken through the check-in process where I was informed that I would be given a 15 minute welcome massage and daily high tea between 430-630pm as well as breakfast. Stepping out of the main lobby area, I entered a labyrinth of pebbled pathways and wooden over pond walkways that led to the 21 rooms on the enormous property! My room was in the farthest corner of the resort as this room had a private pool with ocean views!&nbsp;

## Villa DragonFly&nbsp;

##### Location: Uluwatu

##### Sleeps: 3 bedroom + 1 spare mattress (up to 8 people)

##### Cost: Moderate

##### Where to book: [Airbnb Villa Dragonfly](https://www.airbnb.com.au/rooms/17753866){: target="_blank"}

##### The Instagram shot(s):

The triangular architecture of this Villa makes for some epic shots (especially the common area), the gorgeous pond entrance is probably THE photo to get here on a wide angle lens, and the wooden walkway between bedroom areas and the outdoor spa bath are nice too. Best time to shoot this villa is in the evening.&nbsp;

![](/uploads/balihotels-1.jpg)

##### ![](/uploads/balihotels-3.jpg)

##### ![](/uploads/balihotels-6.jpg)

##### What’s around?

Just a 10 minute walk from Singlefin, this villa is in an extremely convenient location, which is handy in Uluwatu where drivers are hard to come by and overpriced. The breakfast at the villa was was nice but fairly basic; seasonal fruit platter, filtered coffee or tea, choice of scrambled eggs, omelette or pancakes. There are great Cafe’s nearby, my favourite being “Bukit Cafe" which I highly recommend.

##### My Experience:

My stay at Villa Dragonfly was just perfect. When I walked through the turquoise double doors at the entrance of the villa, my first words were ‘wow’. In front of me sit an immaculately kept pond, with stepping stones leading up to the triangular shaped common area of the Villa. Ketut (the villa Manager) was on hand to greet me with a welcome drink of refreshing watermelon juice. Ketut then gave me a grand tour of the villa which revealed many secluded nooks to relax or work in.&nbsp;

## Villa Infinity

##### Location: Canggu

##### Sleeps: 6 bedroom (12 people) + 1 dorm room (sleeps 45 people for events)&nbsp;

##### Cost: Very High

##### Where to book it:
<ins class="bookingaff" data-aid="1527166" data-target_aid="1527166" data-prod="nsb" data-width="100%" data-height="auto" data-dest_id="362459" data-dest_type="hotel">
    <!-- Anything inside will go away once widget is loaded. -->
    <a href="//www.booking.com?aid=1527166">Booking.com</a>

      p.parentNode.insertBefore(s,p);
      })(document, 'script', '//aff.bstatic.com/static/affiliate_base/js/flexiproduct.js');
</script>
##### The Instagram shot(s)

The most instagrammable shots at this villa would be the pool (from either end depending on lighting), the master bedroom with is high ceilings, and interesting bed frame, the outdoor bathtubs, and my favourite; the outdoor cabana with billowing white drapes. I had 2 photoshoots there; 1 in the morning and 1 in the evening and both presented many nicely lit areas to shoot in.&nbsp;

![](/uploads/balihotels-9.jpg)

##### ![](/uploads/balihotels-7.jpg)

##### ![](/uploads/balihotels-10.jpg)

##### What’s around?

Location wise this is a about 15minutes from Canggu main area, despite looking closer on a map, because of the way the roads are set out. There is not a hell of a lot within walking distance but the area is becoming more popular and developed so this may change. The closest beach is Pererenan which is a 15 minute walk or 5 minute drive.&nbsp;

##### My Experience:

This luxury villa was an absolute treat to stay at and Villa Manager Hendra was extremely attentive and professional. With the possibility of sleeping up to 45 guests, this Villa takes the cake in terms of size and grandeur. Most popularly used for weddings and retreats, Villa Infinity did not disappoint in its beauty. I was fortunate to have the entire Villa to myself, staying in the master suite which is the size of small house. My favourite things about this Villa were the crisp white sun beds by the long clean pool, the immaculate lawn and gardens, the impressive surround sound system and the service; I had 7 friends come over for dinner one night and the in-house Chef made us a delicious Indonesian feast.&nbsp;

## New Earth Haven

##### Location: Ubud

##### Sleeps: 1 dome hut, 2 people

##### Cost: Low&nbsp;

##### Where to book it: [New Earth Haven website](https://newearthhaven.com/bali/){: target="_blank"}

##### The Instagram shot(s):

This was probably the most photographable place I have ever stayed. The design of the entrance ways and windows make for unique pics. The turquoise coloured sunken lounge area against white tiling oozes romance and a shot of the bed inside the dome hut is iconic. Best time to shoot is morning.&nbsp;

![](/uploads/balihotels-28.jpg)

##### ![](/uploads/balihotels-29.jpg)

##### ![](/uploads/balihotels-16.jpg)

##### What’s around?

New Earth Haven is about a 15 minute drive North of Ubud, close to Tegalalang Rice Terraces and Jungle Fish. It is definitely worth a visit, even just to see and eat at the restaurant where they serve organic vegan food. The only downside of staying in the dome is security and the insects. There are no windows so make sure you use the safe to store valuables and bring insect repellant!&nbsp;

##### My experience:

A picture that I found on Instagram of the inside of the bamboo dome attracted me to make a booking but asides from that there are relatively few images across social media that show off how amazing this place is! In booking the dome, I did not realise I would also have access to a pool and very beautiful sitting areas inside a complex that had 2 other bedrooms (though these were not made of bamboo). I would also have access to the restaurant across the road called “Akesha” which had an equally impressive structural design and reminded me of the movie Avatar. I immediately called my friend who is a photographer and told him he had to come up and shoot this place with me. My favourite things about staying here was the tranquility of the dome hut, listening to the sounds of nature as I fell asleep, the outdoor bathroom and toilet area and the adorable dogs that must belong to the villa owner.&nbsp;

## Hideout - Lightroom

##### Location: Selat

##### Sleeps: 1 villa, 2 people

##### Cost: Low

##### Where to book it: [Airbnb Hideout Lightroom](https://www.airbnb.com.au/rooms/18761574){: target="_blank"}

##### The Instagram shot(s):

The most popular spot to shoot this villa is the outdoor bathtub which sits up alongside the main structure. You can open a glass door and step straight into the bathtub. The entire room is enclosed by glass windows and doors which may be why it is called the lightroom as there is a continuous supply of light coming through. Here’s what inspired me to want to stay here (all photos credited to their owners).&nbsp;

![](/uploads/screen-shot-2018-05-11-at-11-20-30-am.png)Photo by @maya\_gypsy

##### What’s around?

Both Hideout villas are located 1.5 hrs East of Ubud so you will find plenty of serenity and quiet but not a lot of cafes or people. I highly recommend making a morning trip to Lempuyang Temple for a sunrise which is only 1 hr further East of Hideout.&nbsp;

##### My experience:

Hideout is possibly the most Instagrammed villa in all of Bali and is booked for about 12 months solid. With it’s triangular windowed bedroom and it’s location beside a stream amongst the trees, Hideout definitely deserves a mention on this list, HOWEVER, unless you want to wait for a cancellation, you are better off booking in newly established Lightroom which is Hideouts latest design and comes at half the price! Unfortunately I was unwell at the time of my reservation and was not able to make it out to stay at the Lightroom, however I still wanted to include it in my blog as I was really excited to stay there and still believe it to be extremely photographic.&nbsp;

## Mundok Moding Plantation

##### Location: Gobleg

##### Sleeps: 1, 2, or 4 bedroom villas&nbsp;

##### Cost: Moderate

##### Where to book it:
<ins class="bookingaff" data-aid="1527175" data-target_aid="1527175" data-prod="nsb" data-width="100%" data-height="auto" data-dest_id="354729" data-dest_type="hotel">

      p.parentNode.insertBefore(s,p);
      })(document, 'script', '//aff.bstatic.com/static/affiliate_base/js/flexiproduct.js');
</script>
##### The Instagram shot(s):

Mundok is most well known for the epic mountain view from the Infinity pool. If you are lucky enough to have the right amount of clouds, the sunset is mind blowing! The only down side to such a spectacular shot is that everyone else also wants it! Luckily you can still get an amazing picture midday like I did and if taken at the right angle it looks like you are in the clouds! Some of the villas have private infinity pools so you don’t even have to worry about other people!&nbsp;

![](/uploads/balihotels-43.jpg)

##### ![](/uploads/balihotels-32.jpg)

##### ![](/uploads/balihotels-37.jpg)

##### What’s around?

Staying here is ideal for exploring some of the best waterfalls Bali has to offer! One of which is Mundok waterfall and the hotel offers daily shuttle to the area. The hotel offers daily activities which are free to hotel guests. There is also a spa on site with a large selection of packages. I would suggest at least 2 nights stay here to take full advantage of this location.&nbsp;

##### My experience:

Arriving at the carpark of this resort and having a golf cart come to pick me up was an immediate indication that I was in for a treat. I had arrived with a couple of friends around lunchtime and my room was not ready yet which was completely fine as the restaurant is open to the general public and you are able to get photographs standing at the edge of the infinity pool (only guests are allowed to swim in the pool). The restaurant has some great options; I was a fan of the chicken pizza for dinner and the breakfast was very generous - fruit, plus baked goodies, plus eggs on toast.&nbsp;

## Uluwatu Surf Villas

##### Location: Uluwatu

##### Sleeps: 6 villas (2 or 3 bedroom), 3 suites (1 bedroom)

##### Cost: Moderate - High

##### Where to book it: [Uluwatu Surf Villa website](http://uluwatusurfvillas.com/){: target="_blank"}

##### The Instagram shot(s)

If you want to take pics down at the private beach I would suggest heading down first thing in the morning (around 730am) and utilising the pretty lighting. The sun rises behind the cliff so you won’t actually see the sunrise but the lighting is perfect for fashion or portrait. What you do not want to miss from these villa's is the sunset! From 5pm to 7pm the lighting starts to change from golden to pink and you can capture some great shots either around the villa (the hammock, the pool, in the bedrooms) or out on the grass with the cliff drop and ocean behind you. I could absolutely never tire of that view.

![](/uploads/balihotels-54.jpg)

##### ![](/uploads/balihotels-52.jpg)

##### ![](/uploads/balihotels-58.jpg)

##### What’s around?

You will need a scooter or driver (which can be organised by the villa) to get to any shops or restaurants which are 10 minutes away. The villa has room service which is excellent and affordable. Each Villa also has a fully contained kitchen if you wanted to cook for yourself. There is daily yoga available at the onsite yoga shala and the private beach at the bottom of the cliff below the villas.&nbsp;

##### My experience:

Entering through the double doored, double entrance I found myself in a very modern and spacious open living area. Straight ahead were glass sliding doors that revealed an outdoor seating area, an outdoor pool then green lawn leading to a cliff drop and the ocean beyond. The smell of Ocean air and the refreshing sea breeze was a relief from the constant humidity of Bali. Once you are here you will not want to leave!

## The Mulia Resort&nbsp;

##### Location: Nusa Dua

##### Sleeps: Over 700 rooms

##### Cost: High

##### Where to book it:
<ins class="bookingaff" data-aid="1527171" data-target_aid="1527171" data-prod="nsb" data-width="100%" data-height="auto" data-dest_id="1641034" data-dest_type="hotel">
    <!-- Anything inside will go away once widget is loaded. -->

      var s = d.createElement(sc), p = d.getElementsByTagName(sc)[0];

      p.parentNode.insertBefore(s,p);
      })(document, 'script', '//aff.bstatic.com/static/affiliate_base/js/flexiproduct.js');
</script>
##### The Instagram shot(s):

The reason I wanted to stay here was for a photo at the resort pool lined with statues that lead down onto the beach. When I arrived I realised there were plenty of other great photo locations; the hotel bathrooms, the lobby stairwell, the wedding venues, the bar area. It is worth noting that guests are not allowed to use professional cameras on the premises without special permission.&nbsp;

![](/uploads/balihotels-66.jpg)

##### ![](/uploads/balihotels-79.jpg)

##### ![](/uploads/balihotels-73.jpg)

##### What’s around?

Nusa Dua is the main resort and luxury hotel area of Bali with each resort having its own private beach. This makes it difficult to enjoy the beach in Nusa Dua without booking accommodation and the beaches here are some of the best on the island. The idea of a resort is that it is all inclusive, giving you little reason to leave - there are multiple restaurants, pools, a spa, gym, tennis court, beach and daily activities.&nbsp;

##### My experience:

While I prefer to stay in Villa’s as opposed to hotels or resorts, this really does take the cake as far as resorts go. It is the biggest resort in Bali with over 700 rooms which can accommodate guests for three wedding venues. I was given a tour of the grounds which took 90 minutes because the property is so large, we had to take a golf cart between some areas! I was treated to a 2 hour spa session which was unlike any I have experienced and I strongly suggest forking out the extra coin to get to the spa if you are going to stay here, it is well worth the cost.&nbsp;

## Sahana Villa

##### Location: Seminyak

##### Sleeps: 3 bedroom (6 guests) &nbsp;

##### Cost: Moderate - High

##### Where to book it: [Sahana villas website](http://www.sahanavilla.com/){: target="_blank"}

##### The Instagram shot(s):

The walls around the villa are covered in climbing vines which make for an awesome back drop, especially around the pool area. The beds make for a clean image in the morning light and the outside of wooden villa is also a popular shot. If you want to get a bit artsy you can lower the sun shades for the common area in the morning and get some streaky lighting coming in for a nice effect.&nbsp;

![](/uploads/balihotels-90.jpg)

##### ![](/uploads/balihotels-91.jpg)

##### ![](/uploads/balihotels-92.jpg)

##### What’s around?

What’s NOT around is more the question! This is smack bang in the centre of Seminyak with shops and restaurants at your doorstep. I was impressed with how quiet, safe and secluded it felt for being so close to Seminyak square. There is plenty to do within walking distance but also easy to get a taxi if you want to go exploring the island.&nbsp;

##### My experience:

The staff were very welcoming and attentive. I stayed here with friends over Nyepi (Indonesian New Year and day of silence) which made me appreciate the efforts of the staff so much more as they were working over the festive period. Unable to leave the villa on silent day, the staff came and made us breakfast and checked in on us to make sure we were doing ok. At night we lay out on the grass and enjoyed the night sky light up as all the lights on the island were turned off. It was the perfect place to relax, read a book and watch a DVD.

## Le Pirate Hotel and Bar

##### Location: Nusa Ceningan

##### Sleeps: 2-4 guests per room (king or bunk bed)

##### Cost: Low

##### Where to book it:
<ins class="bookingaff" data-aid="1527172" data-target_aid="1527172" data-prod="nsb" data-width="100%" data-height="auto" data-dest_id="569990" data-dest_type="hotel">

      })(document, 'script', '//aff.bstatic.com/static/affiliate_base/js/flexiproduct.js');
</script>
##### The Instagram shot(s):

These blue and white bungalows are a favourite amongst Instagrammers and it is definitely a cute photo that you can get without having to stay here (slightly annoying for the paying guests though I am sure!) The pool and bar area is also great for photos, especially at sunset with the location of this hotel presenting an amazing view of the sun setting and gorgeous lighting.&nbsp;

![](/uploads/balihotels-44.jpg)

##### ![](/uploads/balihotels-50.jpg)![](/uploads/balihotels-45.jpg)

##### ![](/uploads/balihotels-46.jpg)![](/uploads/balihotels-49.jpg)

##### What’s around?

Nusa Ceningan is located next to Nusa Lembongan (via a yellow bridge) which is an hour boat trip from Bali. Le Pirate is very close to the famous cliff jump on the island and also my favourite place to grab a bite and drink “Sea Breeze”. There are plenty of things to see and do if you make a trip to Lembongan or Ceningan and I personally prefer the views from Ceningan.&nbsp;

##### My experience:

I didn’t actually stay here, I was one of those annoying people that come and take photos in front of your bungalow and use the pool whilst only paying for a drink (or 3…it was happy hour). My friends and I spent the afternoon hanging out at this bar waiting to watch the sunset, and we were not disappointed. The food here was pretty decent as well and the drinks were flowing from 5pm for happy hour.

This is a list of just a few of the many amazing places to stay in Bali, and I am only sharing the places that I stayed or was planning to stay. I hope to continue to explore Bali and add to this list as I know there are other gems out there just waiting to be snapped for Instagram :)&nbsp;
