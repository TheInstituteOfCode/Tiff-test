Choosing where to stay in Bali is hard. Choosing where to stay when you want to take really cool pics is harder…never fear, Tiffany is here! After much research, many emails, and double booking myself on more than 1 occasion; I have put together a list of the most Instagrammable places to stay in Bali!

##### The Instagram shot(s)

The variety of textures used in the construction of Tugu make it an awesome backdrop for fashion photography but make it difficult to capture the property in a way that does it justice. It is one of those places that you really have to see to truly appreciate so if my pictures impress you, then you should definitely check it out in real life. I had to walk around the property 3 times just to take it all in!

##### What's around

Located straight off the main street of Canggu, this sanctuary is a hidden gem!

##### My experience

As soon as you enter the lobby area of Tugu, you know you have stumbled upon something special. The high ceilings, dark wooden beams, long red drapes and giant ancient statue centrepiece, it feels like you have taken a step back in history (royal history). I was greeted with a fresh juice as I was taken through the check-in process where I was informed that I would be given a 15 minute welcome massage and daily high tea between 430-630pm as well as breakfast. Stepping out of the main lobby area, I entered a labyrinth of pebbled pathways and wooden over pond walkways that led to the 21 rooms on the enormous property! My room was in the farthest corner of the resort as this room had a private pool with ocean views!&nbsp;
