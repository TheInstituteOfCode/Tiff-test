  I am an expert at dating dickheads, or Richards as I call them. I’ve dated so
  many Richards over the years and become familiar with their behaviours that I
  came up with a theory for identifying these men which I call the Richard
  Theory. But first let me introduce you to Richard.

Ubud is known as the spiritual centre of Bali; a yogi's playground and the health food lover's heaven. I went in search of an amazing yoga centre and delicious food and found myself disappointed on both counts. I was, however, pleasantly surprised by the activities available if you use Ubud as your base. Read on to find out my Do's an Dont's from my stay in Ubud.

Do's

- Check out Intuitive Flow Yoga. The stunning views from the full-windowed studio and the teachers are well worth a look in for 150 000 IDR per session.

- A sunrise or sunset trek along Campuhan ridge for some close up views of rice fields.

- Eat at Wurang Sopa for a cheap and delicious meal!

- Get an Oreo flavoured ice cream from Ice Dreams.

- Try a Nalu Bowl for Breakfast or Brunch.

- Visit the Monkey Forrest in the morning before it gets too hot. Closes at 6pm.

- Walk around! There are only 3-4 main streets that make up central Ubud and they are filled with shops of all specialties

- Go on the sunrise Trek to Mt Batur. Pickup is EARLY! I'm talking 2am. The hike each way is 2 hours but it is well worth it.

- Go to the famous Tagalalang Rice Terraces and stop by the ?? Coffee Plantation on the way to try their taste sampler tray (for free!) and if you’re game enough, try the Luwak coffee!

- Take a dip at Tegenungan waterfall

- Take a dip in a jungle infinity pool. The Hanging Gardens is the most well known and you can use the pool for a day &nbsp;a small fee. I was fortunate enough to have friends staying at the Padma Resort Ubud which has the longest heated infinity pools in Bali. If you get the chance to check it out, i highly recommend.

Dont’s

- Waste your time and money at the Yoga Barn. I have never been in such an overcrowded and pretentious yoga class.

- Eat at expensive western restaurants. I got food poisoning from a very nice looking Italian restaurant.

- Do yoga classes in the middle of the day. Ubud can get extremely humid and unless you enjoy hot yoga, i suggest you do early morning classes.

- Stay for longer than a week. Ubud is small and there are far more tranquil and relaxing places in Bali than Ubud.

- Plan to spend your nights partying. There are few bars and everywhere is closed by midnight. Consider this your Bali detox.

- Get ripped off at stores with set prices. Lots of places sell the same stuff, so shop around and barter!

In summary, while Ubud was not the yoga mecca I was expecting, nor did I find the food any better than food in other areas of Bali, I did really enjoy the surrounds of Ubud. If you use Ubud as a base to check out some of the sites around town, then you will be pleasantly surprised!
