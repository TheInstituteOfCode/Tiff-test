When my bestie suggested I move to Geraldton for a few months, I jumped at the opportunity to explore more of my own backyard. I knew very little about the Mid-West, the coral coast, and the windy city and I made it my mission to explore at much of the region as possible from my new home in 'Gero'. Read on to find out about my explorations and adventures in the region.

Geraldton City:

Greenough Historical Settlement:

Spend a morning in the Greenough Historical Settlement approximately 20 minutes south of Geraldton for a mere $6 AUD. There is a quaint little Cafe where you can enjoy a coffee and some breakfast before walking around the heritage listed town.

The settlement of Greenough was a thriving agricultural town in the 1860's. The old buildings that you can walk around made up the administrative centre of town and include stores, schools, churches, a homestead and a jail. Some rooms are set up how they would have looked and you are able to examine old tools and instruments from the 1800's. The building sit amongst a picturesque surrounds and, if you're lucky, you may even get a selfie with the local Lama's!

On the drive back to Geraldton, be sure to make a pit stop and get a photo in the Canola fields. The yellow flowered fields spread for miles and make for a perfect picture!

Chapman River:

There are guided walking tours along the river on Saturdays and Sundays run by volunteers. Ask the Geraldton visitors centre for time and departure location. The River begins in Yuna, 60km away from Geraldton and meets the ocean at Sunset beach. You can begin walkinng along the river from a number of locations. The best time of year to walk the trail is August - October when the wildflowers are in bloom. It is a truly beautiful walk with many amazing photo opportunities. Take water, take snacks and spend a day feeling at one with nature!

Ellendale Pool:

Ellendale pool is a naturally formed water hole along the Greenough River about 40 minutess drive South East of Geraldton. Spending a day out here was my favourite activity to do while living in Geraldton. You can visit for a daytrip or you can camp for a small fee of 5 AUD payable to the Geraldton Visitors Centre. There are decent bathroom facilities and barbeques available. The drive there takes you through windmill country and it's worth a stop to get a snap of these giant energy producers. When you arrive at Ellendale pool it is like a secluded oasis. It really feels like you are much further into the outback than 40 minutes. I was extremely impressed by the pristine calm water and the rock cliff formation that made for a great jumping platform into the refreshing water. I visited during spring which meant the temperature of the water was so cold it knocks the breath out of you. There are warning signs that if the temperature is above 24 degrees you shouldn't swim unless you don't mind dying (they don't actually say that but you get the gist).

Northampton:

This very small lies about half an hour North of Geraldton as was once a mining town that was literally called 'The Mines' until 1871. The town had the first public railway in Western Australia and this heritage can be appreciated at the old railway station which houses a collection of railway memorabilia...take a look inside the old carriage windows for a strange surprise! While in town I also had a look at the Motors and Machinery shed which has a shit load of old vehicles and tools which was fun to browse around. Besides some old looking buildings (Chiverton House Historical Building, Visitors Centre, several churches) the only other place i found noteworthy was the Gwalla Church and cemetery. The Church is all but gone apart from some rubble, but the cemetery has a distinctly eery feel to it as you walk around reading the old tombstones. One of the tombstones for a husband and wife showed she was about 20 years his elder, quite the scandal for the times I'm sure!

Hamlin Pool

I don't have a great deal to say about this place...scientifically speaking it is of great significance, but otherwise it is hot and dry and boring. There is an old caravan park where you can stay if you absolutely must but if you can handle a further 2 hour drive then just get yourself to Shark Bay. Hamlin 'pool' itself is a bunch of rocks on the beach with a boardwalk over the top to look down at them. The rocks are actually called Stromatolites, or living rocks, that are responsible for producing oxygen which was the beginning of life on Earth. Like I said, scientifically, pretty freaking important, but for the regular Joe it's something you can give a miss.

Denham

I had the mistaken idea that Shark Bay was actually a town name and Monkey Mia was another town name. Shark Bay is actually the whole peninsula region, Denham is the only town and Monkey Mia is a holiday park not a town. So I was fairly surprised to arrive in Denham and find that it is the only place for miles with phone reception, fuel and a super market. But it was nowhere near as picturesque as I had thought it would be, as I had seen in pictures. The main street opposite the ocean is lined with hotels, motels, restaurants, a liquor store, a pub, the supermarket, bakery and butcher.
