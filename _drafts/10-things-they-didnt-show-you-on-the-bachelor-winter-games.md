If you don’t know by now that reality TV is a highly edited version of events then you have been living in a soap opera bubble. I can tell you right now that what you saw on The Bachelor Winter Games was only a sliver of what went on and even that sliver is edited to follow certain storylines. On a four episode show that is about love and dramatics, there is no room for the storylines of those who didn’t find it.

The mushy and gushy stuff aside, there were some seriously QUALITY moments in the house that just did not fuel the drama or the romance and so were never shown, so I wanted to share with you these 10 moments that never made it to your screens:

### Ben Higgins gives orgasmic massages

It’s probably a good thing they didn’t show this but Ben had me bent over the kitchen bench giving me a massage while discussing spirituality and happiness with Dean and Lesley lol. I quickly lost track of the conversation as I gave in to his magic hands. He gave me a massage on a different day that put me to sleep on his lap. Ben has an energy about him that makes everyone around him want to be better and I wish nothing but happiness and success for the big stud!

### We played spin the bottle

One night when four people were off on dates we decided to play some drinking games, minus Ashley who was off crying and Ben Higgins who was off comforting her. If the bottle landed on you, you got to choose truth or dare. Most people chose to do dares which involved a couple of kisses between people and the first ’Shoey’s’ of the week. If you don’t know, a shoey involves pouring your entire drink (usually a beer) into your shoey and then downing the whole drink while everyone else sings “here’s to (insert name) he’s true blue, he’s a piss-pot through and through, he’s a bastard so they say, tried to go to heaven but he went the other way. he went down, down, down, down (sung as the person guzzles their drink out of the shoe)." Best of all was daring Yuki to give us a sexy pose. She proceeded to crawl onto the table, gave us her best look back and cheekily bit her finger. It was honestly the best/funniest moment. Some things are not lost in translation!&nbsp;

### Things got hot in the Jacuzzi!

Courtney and Lily went in the Jacuzzi on the first night and somehow broke a light globe which meant the Jacuzzi had to be drained and refilled and reheated which took 2 days! The night we were all sitting in the jacuzzi having a good ol' laugh and I expressed that I had been ‘shitting myself’ (Australia colloquialism for being afraid) Ben was horrified, ‘You shat yourself?!” he exclaimed. I have never laughed so hard. After most people left, Christian came out and joined Courtney, Lily and I and the laughs continued. He was telling us about being the winner of Bachelor Switzerland even though he did not speak the language fluently. His story telling and his accent had us all in stitches.

### We had a snowball fight

I got Courtney so hard in the face, I am devastated they did not air it! Running around in the snow was a massive novelty for this Perth girl who has only even seen snow one other time in her life! I never knew how hard it was to roll a snow ball with powdery snow! I ended up just shovelling handfuls at people and not bothering with the rolling part. By the time we went back inside I thought my hands were going to fall off from being so cold!&nbsp;

### We had to sing our national anthems

During the filming for our show introductions we had to sing our national anthems whilst holding our country flag. Unprepared, no music, camera crew watching, a camera in your face and a microphone over head … suffice to say I felt the pressure! I managed to get about half way through the first verse of the Australian National Anthem before I realised, ‘crap I don’t know where I’m going with this…!’ and kind of bumbled my way through the rest of it. Thank goodness they did not show any of us singing but I can imagine the footage would be quite ridiculous.&nbsp;

### Clare spent half an hour blow drying my ass

The night of the second rose ceremony, I had put on my new silk gown from Saint the Label and after a lap of the house I sat down on a futon next to Luke who had a cup of coffee and baileys next to him which of course ended up all over the back of my dress. Coffee and Silk DO NOT go well together. I raced upstairs where one of the minders started dabbing my dress with soda water. Once the dress was soaked Clare came upstairs and offered to blow dry my backside (now that’s a great chick right there!) The camera crew raced in like this was something that would ever actually make it on the show lol.&nbsp;

### We thought we were going to die skiing

I don’t think they really showed just how terrifying that downhill ski route was! We had one hour to practice on pretty much flat ground before attempting the bottom few flags of the course to show that we knew how to turn and to stop. If you could do that you were deemed ‘safe’ to ski the 20(ish) flag course. I don’t know who deemed me safe but I had been having chats on the ski lift with Ben and then Kevin for most of the practice time so I was VERY surprised to be going to the top of the track! A few of the girls were saying they were not going to do it, they didn’t want to die, that we should boycott the event. First up was Claire and she surprised us all by how good she was! Next was meant to be Stassy but she didn’t want to go so then I went with the good old Aussie attitude of giving it a red hot crack! As soon as I passed the start line I fell over hahaha! I went a little bit further before skiing into the bushes and losing a ski. I was saying into my microphone ‘at what point do you guys call this?’ Not sure how the f\*\*k I was going to complete the course but somehow I started to get a rhythm and came in with a time of just under 3 minutes…which was a good 2 minutes slower than everyone else who completed the course lol but hey at least I qualified right!? right?!

### We referred to the room with the double bed as the ‘bang bang’ room

We had a boys dorm room and a girls dorm room where we slept separately but there was also a room downstairs with a double bed which we called the ‘bang bang’ room. Unlike the Bachelor in Paradise, this show did not have the same hook up culture and we were all pretty respectful of other people. To my knowledge the room was not used by an actual couple for an overnight stay but rather was a room where we could have a private chat with producers or just chill out in. I considered going and sleeping in there one night when someone in the girls dorm was snoring but never did.&nbsp;

### I wanted to tie Luke to a chair

On the first night when it was a bit of a scramble to talk to everyone, I was finding it difficult to get much conversation out of Luke. Every time I started talking to him he would need to go somewhere after 5 minutes. I pulled him up for this and he said there was just a lot going on so he was having a hard time focusing. I then told him I was going to force him to speak to me for at least half an hour by strapping him to chair. Stassy was keen to get in on the action and had Rebecca not chosen Luke for her date card, Luke would have been having an interrogation style double date with the Russian Bombshell and this Aussie.

### The guys fashion choices were questionable

I don’t want to name names but Dean…two words….double camouflage…he admitted to only bringing a duffle bag of clothes…meanwhile the girls all had 2 large suitcases! Both Luke and Kevin rocked the full length onesies. The standard of dress for the cocktails parties was widely varied for the men from full dress suits to cardigan and jeans… I don’t know what the American Bachelor is usually like, but in Australia, wearing a suit is a must at the cocktail parties and rose ceremonies. So while those underdressed gave the guys dressed up shit for trying too hard, the guys who ‘overdressed’ in my opinion looked far more appropriate for the occasion. Each time was pretty entertaining to watch the guys poke fun at each other. Personally I think Courtney was best dressed for the men, not that I’m biased towards my fellow Aussie at all ;p&nbsp;

I’m sure there were plenty of other memorable moments that I didn’t see and were not shown but I just wanted to mention these few, both for your entertainment and for my own record. It’s a shame that these were not shown but as I said, the show isn’t about the house dynamics but rather the search for love. Personally I think they should roll out a side show of all the behind the scenes stuff that actually made the experience one I will never forget and where I was almost always smiling and laughing rather than crying! It really was a pleasure to be a part of this experience and witness the start of some wonderful relationships. I’m pretty sure this was the best version of the Bachelor ever…you should probably watch to decide for yourselves!&nbsp;
